			<h2>Visualizing Country VS Number of waste treatment plants VS Total waste disposed VS total percent of waste disposed</h2>
			<p>The data is grouped by country and the total waste is calculated for each country. The percentage of waste for each country is also calculated, and the data is sorted by waste percentage in descending order. A new DataFrame is created to count the number of occurrences of each country in the dataset, and the column name is changed to 'plants_total'. The two DataFrames are then merged, and the resulting table is styled using pandas' Styler class. The table is then displayed.</p>

		<section id="ANALYZE">
			<h2>Analyzing COUNTRY vs WASTE DISPOSED by the COUNTRY</h2>
			<p>The data is then plotted using a bar chart. The data is grouped by country and the total waste is calculated for each country. The top 50% and bottom 50% of the data are plotted separately on two subplots. The x-axis labels and tick labels are set, the y-axis label and titles are set, and the subplots are given a common title. Gridlines are added to both subplots.</p>

			<h2>Effects of Water Pollution</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>In conclusion, water treatment plants play a crucial role in ensuring that the water we consume is safe and free from harmful contaminants. Across the world, many countries have invested in water treatment plants to provide clean and safe water for their citizens.</li>
				<li>However, despite these efforts, many people still lack access to clean water due to various factors such as lack of infrastructure, poor management, and inadequate resources. There is a need for continued investment in water treatment plants, particularly in developing countries where access to clean water is still a major challenge.</li>
				<li>Additionally, there is a need for increased awareness among the public on the importance of water conservation and reducing pollution to minimize the need for extensive water treatment. Overall, water treatment plants are an essential aspect of ensuring safe and clean water for communities across the world.</li>
