			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Water potability refers to whether water is safe for consumption by humans and animals. Potable water should not contain harmful levels of pollutants or microorganisms that can cause illness.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="testing">
			<h2>Testing for Water Potability</h2>
			<p>Water potability can be tested using a variety of methods, including chemical analysis and microbial testing. The World Health Organization (WHO) sets standards for water quality and provides guidelines for testing.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="contaminants">
			<h2>Common Water Contaminants</h2>
				<p>Bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms</<p></p>
				<p>Chemical pollutants such as pesticides, heavy metals, and solvents</p>
				<p>Natural substances such as arsenic and radon</p>
		</section>

		<section id="treatment">
			<h2>Water Treatment Methods</h2>
			<p>To ensure water potability, it is important to treat water sources to remove contaminants and regularly test water quality. Drinking water treatment methods include filtration, disinfection, and distillation.</p>
